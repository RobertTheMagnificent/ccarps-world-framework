# Oddities #

## Oddity Creation Guide ##
Oddities are character traits that can be chosen by players at character creation or given by Game Masters during play as situations arise. Oddities define things like which hand the character is dominant in using for a particular task, and how curious or adventurois the character is.

Each oddity has a positive and negative variant, and each variant can have an extreme and a moderate version. Generally each Oddity will have a name and a sub-name to determine the severity. Each Oddity will also have an associated point cost and modifier value or values. In the case there is a variant shown with a cost of 0 this is the assumed variant if none is taken specifically. In some rare cases the positive and negative modifier are determined by situational circumstances and the oddity will only have one variation. In these rare cases the point cost will never be 0.
