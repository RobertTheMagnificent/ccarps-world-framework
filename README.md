# CCARPS World Framework

We believe that the game system and game content should always be separate so that each area is easier to maintain. We also don't like it when game world materials are too tightly stuck to the rules; rules that can't function without the content shouldn't be part of our core framework.

This repository is structured in a way that is easy to get started with a simple game, or to download/fork and add custom content.
